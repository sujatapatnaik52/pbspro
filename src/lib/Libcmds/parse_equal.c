/**
 * @brief
 * 	parse_equal_string - parse a string of the form:
 *		name1 = value1[, value2 ...][, name2 = value3 [, value4 ...]]
 *	into <name1> <value1[, value2 ...>
 *	     <name2> <value3 [, value4 ...>
 *
 *	On the first call,
 *		*name will point to "name1"
 *		*value will point to "value1 ..." upto but not
 *			including the comma before "name2".
 *	On a second call, with start = NULL,
 *		*name will point to "name2"
 *		*value will point t0 "value3 ..."
 *
 * @param[in]	start	the start of the string to parse
 * @param[in]	name    set to point to the name string
 * @param[in]  	value	set to point to the value string
 *
 *      start is the start of the string to parse.  If called again with
 *      start  being a null pointer, it will resume parsing where it stoped
 *      on the prior call.

 * @return	int
 * @retval	1 	if  name and value are found
 * @retval	0 	if nothing (more) is parsed (null input)
 * @retval	-1 	if a syntax error was detected.
