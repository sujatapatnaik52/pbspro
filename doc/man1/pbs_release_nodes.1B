.SH NAME
.B pbs_release_nodes 
\- release vnodes assigned to a PBS job
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pbs_release_nodes
[-j <job ID>] <vnode> [<vnode> [<vnode>] ...]
.br
.B pbs_release_nodes 
[-j <job ID>] -a
.br
.B pbs_release_nodes
--version
.SH DESCRIPTION

You can use the 
.B pbs_release_nodes 
command to release no-longer-needed
vnodes assigned to a running job, before the job would normally
release them.  These vnodes are then available for use by other jobs.

You can specify the names of vnodes to be released, or you can release
all vnodes not on the primary execution host that are assigned to a
running job via the 
.I -a 
option.

.B Caveats and Restrictions
.br
You can release only vnodes that are not on the primary execution
host.  You cannot release vnodes on the primary execution host.

The job must be running (in the 
.I R 
state).

The pbs_release_nodes command is not supported on vnodes tied to Cray
X* series systems (vnodes whose 
.I vntype 
has the "cray_" prefix).

The pbs_release_nodes command is not supported for vnodes managed by
cpuset MoMs; partial release of vnodes may result in leftover cpusets.

If cgroups support is enabled, and pbs_release_nodes is called to
release some but not all the vnodes managed by a MoM, resources on
those vnodes that are part of a cgroup are not released until the
entire cgroup is released.

.B Required Privilege
.br
This command can be run by the job owner, the PBS Manager, Operator,
and Administrator, as well as root on Linux and Admin on Windows.

.SH Options to pbs_release_nodes

.IP "-a" 10
Releases all job vnodes not on the primary execution host.  Cannot be
used with list of vnode names.

.IP "-j <job ID>" 10

Specifies the job ID for the job whose vnode(s) are to be released.

.IP "(no options)" 10
Without the 
.I -j 
option, pbs_release_nodes uses the value of the
.I PBS_JOBID 
environment variable as the job ID of the job whose vnodes are to be released.

.IP "--version" 10
The pbs_release_nodes command returns its PBS version information and exits.
This option can only be used alone.

.SH Operands for pbs_release_nodes
The pbs_release_nodes command can take as an operand a list of vnodes.  Format:
.br
.I <vnode name> [<vnode name> [<vnode name>] ...]
.br
Cannot be used with the 
.I -a 
option.

.SH Usage
This command can be run at the command line, or called inside a job
script, where it can use the value of the 
.I PBS_JOBID 
environment variable.

You can release any vnode that appears in the job's 
.I exec_vnode 
attribute that is not on the primary execution host.  You can release
a particular set of a job's vnodes, or you can release all of a job's
non-primary-execution-host vnodes.

To release specific vnodes:
.br
.I pbs_release_nodes [-j <job ID>] <vnode name> [<vnode name>] ...]

To release all of a jobÕs vnodes that are not on the primary execution host:
.br
.I pbs_release_nodes [-j <job ID>] -a
