/*
 * The data structures, macros and functions in this header file are used for
 * compressing the list of IP addresses sent across from the
 * server to the MOM(s) as part of the IS_CLUSTER_ADDRS2 message.
 *
 * The high-level algorithm is to reduce a given set of IP addresses to range(s)
 * E.g.: Given: 1,2,3,4,5,8,9,10,11 => {1-5},{8,11}
 * The ranges are stores as an ordered pair: (a,b). The first element 'a' refers
 * to the first IP address in the range and the second element 'b' refers to
 * the number of continuous IP addresses.
 * e.g. (1,5) => {1,2,3,4,5,6}  from 1  to (1+5)
 *      (5,3) => {5,6,7,8}      from 5  to (5+3)
 *     (11,0) => {11}           from 11 to (11+0)
 *
 * Each ordered pair is represented by a 'PBS_IP_RANGE' data structure.
 * For a given ordered pair (a,b), the first element 'a' is referred
 * to as 'ra_low' and the second element 'b' is referred to as 'ra_high' in the
 * code/documentation.
