/**
 * @file	attr_fn_intr.c
 * @brief
 * 	This file contains functions for manipulating attributes of type
 *		interactive
 * @details
 * Each set has functions for:
 *	Decoding the value string to the machine representation.
 *	Encoding the machine representation of the value to a string
 *	Setting the value by =, + or - operators.
 *	Comparing a (decoded) value with the attribute value.
 *	Freeing the space malloc-ed to the attribute value.
 *
 * Some or all of the functions for an attribute type may be shared with
 * other attribute types.
 *
 * The prototypes are declared in "attribute.h"

 * Set of General functions for attributes of type interactive

 *
 * This attribute contains the port number to which an Interactive qsub is
 * listening.

/**
 * @brief
 * 	encode_inter - encode attribute of type ATR_TYPE_STR to attr_extern
 *
 *	Special case for "interactive" attribute,  encode into TRUE/FALSE
 *	for  client, encode into port number for all others.
 *
 * @param[in] attr - ptr to attribute to encode
 * @param[in] phead - ptr to head of attrlist list
 * @param[in] atname - attribute name
 * @param[in] rsname - resource name or null
 * @param[in] mode - encode mode
 * @param[out] rtnl - ptr to svrattrl
 *
 * @retval      int
 * @retval      >0      if ok, entry created and linked into list
 * @retval      =0      no value to encode, entry not created
 * @retval      -1      if error
