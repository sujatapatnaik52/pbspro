 *		protocol version, request type, and user name) have been decoded.
 *
 * @par	Data items are:\n
 *		signed int	resource handle\n
 *		unsigned int	count of resource queries\n
 *	followed by that number of:\n
 *		string		resource list
 *
 * @param[in] sock - socket descriptor
 * @param[out] preq - pointer to batch_request structure
 *
 * @return      int
 * @retval      DIS_SUCCESS(0)  success
