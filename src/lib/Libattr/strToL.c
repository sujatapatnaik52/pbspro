/**
 * @brief
 * 	strToL - returns the Long value representing the string whose first
 *	character is *nptr, when interpreted as an integer in base, base.
 *
 * @param[in]   	nptr - pointer to string to convert to u_Long
 * @param[in/out]   	endptr -  If endptr is not NULL,the function stores
 *              		the address of the first invalid character in *endptr.
 * @param[in] 		base - If base is zero, the base of the integer is determined by the way the
 * 			string starts.  The string is interpreted as decimal if the first
 * 			character after leading white space and an optional sign is a digit
 * 			between 1 and 9, inclusive.  The string is interpreted as octal if the
 * 			first character after leading white space and an optional sign is the
 * 			digit "0" and the next character is not an "X" (either upper or lower
 * 			case).  The string is interpreted as hexidecimal if the first character
 * 			after leading white space and an optional sign is the digit "0",
 * 			followed by an "X" (either upper or lower case).
 *
 * 	If base is greater than 1 and less than the number of characters in the
 *	Long_dig array, it represents the base in which the number will be
 *	interpreted.  Characters for digits beyond 9 are represented by the
 *	letters of the alphabet, either upper case or lower case.
 *
 * @return Long Returns the result of the conversion
 * @retval >= 0 The result of the conversion
 * @retval 0    FAILURE
