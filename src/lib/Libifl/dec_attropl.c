/**
 * @brief
 *	decode into a list of PBS API "attropl" structures
 *
 *	The space for the attropl structures is allocated as needed.
 *
 *	The first item is a unsigned integer, a count of the
 *	number of attropl entries in the linked list.  This is encoded
 *	even when there are no entries in the list.
 *
 *	Each individual entry is encoded as:
 *		u int	size of the three strings (name, resource, value)
 *			including the terminating nulls, see dec_svrattrl.c
 *		string	attribute name
 *		u int	1 or 0 if resource name does or does not follow
 *		string	resource name (if one)
 *		string  value of attribute/resource
 *		u int	"op" of attrlop (also flag of svrattrl)
 *
 *	Note, the encoding of a attropl is the same as the encoding of
 *	the pbs_ifl.h structures "attrl" and the server struct svrattrl.
 *	Any one of the three forms can be decoded into any of the three with
 *	the possible loss of the "flags" field (which is the "op" of the
 *	attrlop).
 *
 * @param[in]   sock - socket descriptor
 * @param[in]   ppatt - pointer to list of attributes
 *
 * @return int
 * @retval 0 on SUCCESS
 * @retval >0 on failure
